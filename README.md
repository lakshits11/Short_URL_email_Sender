# Shortening the URL and sending it to our email

A code in Python to shorten the large URL and E-Mail the shortened URL.

## *****Why ?*****

Many times, when I am on my laptop, I come across many large and big links which I want to send to my phone so I can read them after anytime and quickly without wasting any time.
So I just thought it would be great if I could just write a code in Python which shortens the link as well as send the shortened link to my E-Mail so I can read that later on my mobile phone. So this is that code.

## Things needed:
 

 - **Another Google account**
 We will need a google account which we will use for this purpose. I don't suggest you to use your main email address for this task. So just create another google account and go to [Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and turn on the checkbox to allow access to less secure apps.
 
 - **Bitly API**
We will be using Bitly API for shortening the URL. You can read the documentation at [Bitly API Documentation.](https://dev.bitly.com/)


- **Sending EMAIL in Python**
	I have used smtplib module to send the email . You can read the detailed guide for this at [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send-mail-gmail-account-using-python/)
